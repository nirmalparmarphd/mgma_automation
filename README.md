# mgma_automation
Mathematical Gnostics (MG) Marginal Analysis (MA) automation code

> This code does not include the 'MG' package inbuilt. It is an extended code to automate the data analysis by the MG method who already purchased or authorized to use the MG package.

# MWE
Minimum Working Example of npmg.m code.
```
# run code
octave npmg.m
```
This code will run a loop over datasets and calculate the gnostics intervals (tolerance interval and interval of typical data) for each data point.

The npmg code can also perform a regression with a gnostic function for analyzed data.

The result of MG marginal analysis will be stored in the excel file and the regression result will be stored in a text file.
